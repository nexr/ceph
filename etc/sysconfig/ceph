## automatically restart systemd units on upgrade
#
# By default, it is left to the administrator to restart
# ceph daemons (or their related systemd units) manually
# when the 'ceph' package is upgraded. By setting this
# parameter to "yes", package upgrade will trigger a
# "systemctl try-restart" on all the ceph systemd units
# currently active on the node.
